# PatatapWebcam 

I love Patatap (https://www.patatap.com). I thought it would be fun to play with it with a different interface. So I wrote a program that opens Patatap (in your default browser), turns on your webcam (nothing funky I promise!), and sends keystrokes to play Patatap depending on where there is movement in a 5x5 grid (no 'z' sorry).

Written in Processing 3.3.6 ((https://processing.org/)), tested in Windows and Chrome.

Also try opening a text editor while the program is running.
